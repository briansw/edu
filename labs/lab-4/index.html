      Design the login and account creation experience for their mobile app.
    </p>

    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Research</strong> (15 min). What can you learn from existing products? What works, what doesn't?</li>
      <li><strong>Define feature set</strong> (15 min). What are all the actions a user can take during the login and account creation process? What's required, what's optional?</li>
      <li><strong>Create user flows</strong> (30 min). Map the user’s journey of the experience. How does the user move from one interaction to the next?</li>
      <li><strong>Design the experience</strong> (60 min). Iterate design solutions. Consider a range of possible solutions including ones that deviate from the user flows created above.</li>
      <li><strong>Prototype</strong> (15 min). Build a lightweight prototype in Sketch focusing on the <strong>Golden Paths</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Document</strong> (5 min). Record a short video of your prototype in use with Quicktime and upload.</li>
    </ol>
