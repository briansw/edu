      <h2>Phases</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Research</strong> (15 min). What can you learn from existing products? What works, what doesn't?</li>
        <li><strong>Define feature set</strong> (15 min). What are all the actions a user can take during the login and account creation process? What's required, what's optional?</li>
        <li><strong>Create user flows</strong> (30 min). Map the user’s journey of the experience. How does the user move from one interaction to the next?</li>
        <li><strong>Design the experience</strong> (60 min). Iterate design solutions. Consider a range of possible solutions including ones that deviate from the user flows created above.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype</strong> (15 min). Build a lightweight prototype in Sketch focusing on the <strong>Golden Paths</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Document</strong> (5 min). Record a short video of your prototype in use with Quicktime and upload.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Usability testing</h2>
      <p>Using Sketch Mirror, conduct 5 usability tests for the login and create an account experience. Usability tests help you uncover issues with the experience you designed. You'll gain insight into where your assumptions differ from the user's. Ask the user to speak out loud their thought process as they interact with the prototype.</p>
      <p>Take notes and ask probing questions to help you better understand their thought process. Use the insights learned from your tests to refine the experience and document the design via Quicktime and upload to your course home page.</p>
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> it's never the user's fault if they have trouble with the experience you designed – it's yours. Embrace the feedback.</p>
